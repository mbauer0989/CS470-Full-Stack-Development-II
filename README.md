# CS470-Full-Stack-Development-II

Developed a full stack application that runs in the cloud. Through the application of cloud-based development principles and best practices, took the software stack from Full Stack Development I and utilized frameworks to build the cloud architecture upon which the software stack application will run. In addition, I demonstrated career-readiness by articulating highly technical content to various audiences and in various formats. This course is the second course in a two-course sequence.
